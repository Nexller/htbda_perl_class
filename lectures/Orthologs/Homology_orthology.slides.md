#Comparative genomics

* Studying similarities and differences between genomes of species
* Identifying similar sequences among genomes
* Inferring evolutionary history
* Comparing gene order

#Similarity identification

* Sequence alignment approach - see [an animation](http://statgen.ncsu.edu/slse/animations/module1.html).
* [BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [FASTA & SSEARCH](http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_list2.shtml), [BLAT](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html) are tools for sequence similarity identification
* DNA and Protein sequences can be compared and aligned
* However sometimes hard to determine if genes are similar by simple one-way look

#Orthologs and Paralogs

![Orthologs](orthologs.gif)

---
#Trees can help resolve relationships


---
#Reciprocal Searches

* Bi-directional or Reciprocal BLAST


---
#Implement Bidirectional

---
#Clustering

* Lumping genes together based on similarity linkage
* Single-linkage means if there is a link between A-B then they are in a cluster


---
#Implement single-linkage clustering


---
#Ortholog finding

* Other automated tools include
* OrthoMCL
    * Does Clustering with a tool called MCL (Markov Clustering)
    * Corrects for paralogs
