Practice problems week #4

1. Fix syntax or run-time errors in the following scripts:

* print_line_num.pl (use “print_line_input.txt” as input file)
* [sum.pl](week4/sum.pl)
* [temp_convert.pl](week4/temp_convert.pl)
* [unit.pl](week4/unit.pl)

These scripts will be on the biocluster under /home/rliu/GEN220 and
will be also posted to the GEN220 course website (linked above).

2. Colin McMillen used a Perl script “propose.pl” to ask Kristen
Stubbs to marry him. The script is cute, but not very readable. Please
reformat this script so that it follows the conventions for “beautiful
code”. You may add comments or change variable names if you want, but
the output should be the same.

* script [propose.pl](week4/propose.pl)
