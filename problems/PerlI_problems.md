===================================

Each of these bullet points is expected output from the program.


1. Write code to print out the following message on one line, and the
   reverse of it, in lowercase.

        DAMIT I'M MAD

2. For the following peptide:

    VHLTPVEKSAVTALWGKVNVDEVGGEALGRLLVVYPWTQRFFESFGDLSTPDAVMGNPKVKA
	HGKKVLGAFSDGLAHLDNLKGTFATLSELHCDKLHVDPENFRLLGNVLVCVLAHHFGKEFTP
	PVQAAYQKVVAGVANALAHKYH

	 Print out the info, each on its own line describing
	  * the total length of the protein
	  * the starting location of the motif MGNP in the sequence
